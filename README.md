# Flashcards Command Line Tool


## About

I'm currently prepping for the GRE as a requirement for MSCS programs. As a part of my prep work, I was using Quizlet to memorize vocab words. 
While I enjoyed some of the features on Quizlet, I wanted to use study strategies that were tough to implement in the free tier of the Quizlet
app. I decided to instead build a small tool for command lines to make and review flashcards.

## Features

The tool supports several study strategy modes. Please type in `help` for more info. Additionally, the 
app supports importing pdf and csv files. You can also quiz yourself on the flashcards. Please also look at the
`help` section on the configuration values that you can set and what values to set them too.
